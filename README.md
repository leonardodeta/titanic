# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **titanic.ipynb**: The main notebook that includes all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **data/**: Directory to store the dataset (not included in this repository).
- **models/**: Directory to store saved models (not included in this repository).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leonardodeta/titanic.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```cd titanic```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running the Notebook
1. Open jupyter notebook
   jupyter notebook

2. Open and run all cells in titanic.ipynb.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and feature engineering.
2. **Modeling**: Building and tuning a machine learning model using GridSearchCV.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using metrics such as confusion matrix.

### Results
The project shows the process of finding the best model for predicting Titanic survival, including the evaluation of its performance.
